      <h2>About</h2>
      <hr width="820px">
      <p>In 2013, one of the co-founders of TopDeck mentioned that he had to visit three different sites to fully design a Magic: <br> The Gathering proxy deck. He noted the difficulty of finding new cards on Cockatrice, and that he had to visit multiple sites <br> to first choose his cards, and then to generate proxies for them.</p>
      <p> We at TopDeck have come together to build an application that allows you to search for cards, build decks, and generate <br> proxies all in one place. Among other things, TopDeck offers:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Export and import to and from Cockatrice so that you can use your decks online competitively.</li>
          <li> Choice of proxy art by set per card. Want two types of Mishra's Factory art? TopDeck can do it.</li>
          <li> Quick and easy generation of proxies inside your browser</li>
          <li> Tracking of cards in your main deck and in your sideboard.</li>
          <li> Easy update of the card database for when a new deck comes out.</li>
          <li> Statistics about your deck.</li>
          <li> Two color themes so you can feel in your element. </li>
        </ul>
      <p>So what does TopDeck need to run?</p>
      <p>TopDeck runs on Windows 7, 8, and 10. To see images, generate proxies, and update, TopDeck requires internet. Without <br> internet, TopDeck will still show you basic information about a card.</p>
      <p> Sound interesting? Feel free to jump on over to our downloads page, where we'll give you some information on how to <br> get started.</p>
